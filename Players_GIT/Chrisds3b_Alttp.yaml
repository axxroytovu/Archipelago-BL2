    none: 0 # Vanilla game map. All entrances and exits lead to their original locations. You probably want this option

    dungeonsfull: 0 # Shuffle any dungeon entrance with any dungeon interior, so Hyrule Castle can be 4 different dungeons, but keep dungeons to a specific world
    dungeonscrossed: 0 # like dungeonsfull, but allow cross-world traversal through a dungeon. Warning: May force repeated dungeon traversal
    simple: 0 # Entrances are grouped together before being randomized. Simple uses the most strict grouping rules
    restricted: 0 # Less strict than simple
    full: 0 # Less strict than restricted
    crossed: 50 # Less strict than full
    insanity: 0 # Very few grouping rules. Good luck
    # you can also define entrance shuffle seed, like so:
    crossed-1000: 0 # using this method, you can have the same layout as another player and share entrance information
    # however, many other settings like logic, world state, retro etc. may affect the shuffle result as well.
    crossed-group-myfriends: 0 # using this method, everyone with "group-myfriends" will share the same seed
