## Installation Procedures

Make sure a copy of the Manual world is in the lib/world directory of your client-side installation.

### Optional install:

1. Open the link in [Optional Software](#optional-software) or using this [direct link](https://outerwildsmods.com/mod-manager/)
2. Press the 'Big Green Download Button' or the portable version link under it.
3. Save the downloaded installer somewhere.
    1. If you downloaded the portable version save it somewhere easy to access and that you wont forget.
4. Run the installer, the Mod Manager should start automatically.
    1. If you downloaded the portable version launch the OuterWilds Mod Manager.
5. First you have to install the OWML mod (should be the first in the list)  
by pressing the download icon (third button from the right)
6. To install the mods you either find them in the list and press download icon  
or you can search for them by name at the top of the Mod tab 
7. Once you have all the mods you want press the Start Game button at the top, it will enable all the mods  
you installed and after that you'll only need to start from the Mod Manager when you add/remove/update mods

## Joining a MultiWorld Game

- Launch the client.  
- At the top enter your server's ip with the port provided (by default archipelago.gg:38281).  
- In Manual Game ID put "Manual_OuterWilds_Nicopopxd" then press the Connect button on the top right.  
- In the command field at the bottom enter the name of your slot you chose in your Player.yaml then press enter.  

## Manual Client

In the "Tracker and Locations" tab you'll find buttons corresponding with all the available locations in the Randomizer.  
Since this is a manual game its built on trust™ you press the locations when you get to them,  
hopefully in the futur only what you can access will be visible but at the moment  
you could press victory and it would accept it.

## Main Game

- Launch the game
- Either make a new Profile (maybe call it randomizer) or start a expedition(will wipe the save on the current profile)
- Press new expedition 
    - (or continue expedition if you are loading a save from the randomizer)
