## Where is the settings page?
The player settings page for this game is located <a href="../player-settings">here</a>. It contains all the options
you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
For now, everything in the "0 - Beginning" category can be accessed from the start.  
- You needs the "launch codes" item to get to the ship.
- Everything that gives a signal need that signal item and the signaloscope item,
- Most "talk to" location require the "Signal > OW Ventures" signal (except for Solanum)
- Going to anything quantum needs the "Signal > Quantum" item (to help with progression)
- all the categories starting with "# - " then a planet name contains every locations of that planet
- For now no going into Sunless city from a shortcut unless you have "signal > distress"

## What is the goal of a Manual game when randomized?
At minimum you need to have both seen and received the warpdrive and Coords for the eye and every [Knowledges](#knowledges)  
And then Grab the warpdrive in game get to the Vessel and Warp to the eye.  
For a more detailed requirement check [Here](#needed-for-go-mode).

## Which items can be in another player's world?
Most item can be in another player'S world except for all the "Seen X" items and 3 random local item that are not traps.

## What if I have items, unlocks, or locations that I'd like to not have randomized?
It's all manual. Just exclude them from either the item or location list. 

## How do I install the mod for a Manual game?
There is no mandatory mods for this game. For more info look at the <a href="../../../tutorial/Manual_OuterWilds_Nicopopxd/setup/en"> setup guide</a>.
